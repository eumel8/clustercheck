## intro

clustercheck is a little helper to check the current health of a Kubernetes cluster.

It checks pre-defined KPI while query Prometheus backend. For that some requirements are needed:

* access to Prometheus from command line, between https_proxy variable
* configured `kubeconfig`, clustercheck will use the current context


## download

We provide binaries for various platform. Go to the [release page](https://github.com/eumel8/clustercheck/releases).

## tips & tricks

### remove quarantine flag on Mac

```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine $HOME/bin/clustercheck
```

### overwriting cluster name

```
export CLUSTER="my-cluster"
```

### overwrite prometheus url

```
export PROMETHEUS_URL="https://my-prometheus.instance"
```

### set basic auth credentials to access Prometheus

```
export PROM_USER="user"
export PROM_PASS="pass"
```

## Bitwarden feature

Start the programm with `-bw` or set env var

```
export CLUSTERCHECK_BW=1
```

In this version the programm expect an item on a Bitwarden service containing username/password for HTTP Basic Auth on
Prometheus API

```
bw get item "Prometheus Agent RemoteWrite
```


### set FQDN

If your cluster has a FQDN which is specific to set start the programm with `-f` together with the FQDN or set env var

```
CLUSTERCHECK_FQDN=example.com
```

### Prometheus TLS connection

we skip SSL verification and allow insecure connection by default, take care.

### Proxy Settings

we respect env vars like `http_proxy` or `https_proxy` for Prometheus endpoint connection from your computer.
